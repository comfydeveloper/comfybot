# Comfybot
A comfy twitch bot.
This is a small learning project. If you look for a place to learn or to find ideas for your own first bot, feel free to check out my code!

## Features
The bot currently has three simple main features: 

### Text Commands
The text command feature lets you add simple commands that only reply with one or more random text messages.

### Message Responses
To make the chat more lively and give your bot some more charm, you can let it reply to certain people or messages or keywords with one or more random messages.

### Shoutout Command
Have friends or followers you want to give some extra credit? Use the shoutout command to see highlight their names, some information or a link to their social media profiles.
The message "border" will be made configurable later.
